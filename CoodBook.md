Modifications
1) The data for traing and test set was merged.
2) Only mean and standard deviation measurements were extracted.
3) Column names for activity and subject were given and these columns were also give descriptive variable names.
4) An independent tidy data data set with only average values was created and saved.

Identifiers-
1) Subject- the ID of the text subject ranging from 1 to 30.
2) Activity- the type of activity performed by the text subject for which the measurements are taken. 

Activity Labels-
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING
